## Mechanics and Functions

### 1. Game Structure

The core of the That Damn Dawg! game is managed by the `Game` struct:

```solidity
struct Game {
    address creator;
    address joiner;
    uint256 betAmount;
    string creatorMove;
    string joinerMove;
    GameStatus status;
    uint256 creationTime;
    uint256 lastMoveTime;
    address winner;
    string avatars; // Format: "creatorAvatar;joinerAvatar"
}
```

### 2. Game Status

The `GameStatus` enum represents the different states a game can be in:

```solidity
enum GameStatus { CREATED, JOINED, DRAW, REDRAW, COMPLETED, ABANDONED }
```

### 3. Creating a Game

The `createGame` function allows a user to create a new game:

```solidity
function createGame(uint256 betAmount, string memory move, string memory creatorAvatar) external payable notBlacklisted nonReentrant {
    // Ensure new games are not paused
    require(!newGamesPaused, "New games are paused");
    // Ensure the correct bet amount is sent
    require(msg.value == betAmount, "Incorrect bet amount");
    // Ensure the move is valid
    require(isValidMove(move), "Invalid move");

    // Increment the game ID
    uint256 gameId = nextGameId++;

    // Create the game
    games[gameId] = Game({
        creator: msg.sender,
        joiner: address(0),
        betAmount: betAmount,
        creatorMove: move,
        joinerMove: "",
        status: GameStatus.CREATED,
        creationTime: block.timestamp,
        lastMoveTime: block.timestamp,
        winner: address(0),
        avatars: string(abi.encodePacked(creatorAvatar, ";"))
    });

    // Update mappings and arrays
    playerGames[msg.sender].push(gameId);
    activeGameIds.push(gameId);
    valueSpent[msg.sender] += betAmount;

    // Emit the GameCreated event
    emit GameCreated(gameId, msg.sender, betAmount, games[gameId].avatars);
}
```

### 4. Joining a Game

The `joinGame` function allows a user to join an existing game:

```solidity
function joinGame(uint256 gameId, uint256 betAmount, string memory move, string memory joinerAvatar) external payable gameExists(gameId) notBlacklisted nonReentrant {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];
    // Ensure the game is available to join
    require(game.status == GameStatus.CREATED, "Game is not available");
    // Ensure the correct bet amount is sent
    require(msg.value == betAmount, "Incorrect bet amount");
    // Ensure the bet amount matches the creator's bet
    require(betAmount == game.betAmount, "Bet amount does not match");
    // Ensure the move is valid
    require(isValidMove(move), "Invalid move");

    // Update game details
    game.joiner = msg.sender;
    game.joinerMove = move;
    game.status = GameStatus.JOINED;
    game.lastMoveTime = block.timestamp;
    game.avatars = string(abi.encodePacked(game.avatars, joinerAvatar));

    // Update mappings and arrays
    playerGames[msg.sender].push(gameId);
    valueSpent[msg.sender] += betAmount;

    // Finalize the game
    finalizeGame(gameId);

    // Emit the GameJoined event
    emit GameJoined(gameId, msg.sender, game.avatars);


}
```

### 5. Finalizing a Game

The `finalizeGame` function determines the winner of the game:

```solidity
function finalizeGame(uint256 gameId) internal {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];

    // Calculate the battle fee and reward
    uint256 battleFee = (game.betAmount * battleFeePercent) / 100;
    uint256 reward = (game.betAmount * 2) - battleFee;
    totalFeesCollected += battleFee;
    totalValueCollected += game.betAmount * 2;

    // Get the moves
    Move creatorMove = getMoveFromString(game.creatorMove);
    Move joinerMove = getMoveFromString(game.joinerMove);

    // Determine the winner
    if (creatorMove == joinerMove) {
        game.status = GameStatus.DRAW;
        game.creatorMove = "";
        game.joinerMove = "";
        emit GameDraw(gameId);
    } else if (
        (creatorMove == Move.MAN && joinerMove == Move.DAWG) ||
        (creatorMove == Move.HOLE && joinerMove == Move.MAN) ||
        (creatorMove == Move.DAWG && joinerMove == Move.HOLE)
    ) {
        game.winner = game.creator;
        unclaimedRewards[game.creator] += reward;
        valueWon[game.creator] += reward;
        gamesWon[game.creator]++;
        game.status = GameStatus.COMPLETED;
    } else {
        game.winner = game.joiner;
        unclaimedRewards[game.joiner] += reward;
        valueWon[game.joiner] += reward;
        gamesWon[game.joiner]++;
        game.status = GameStatus.COMPLETED;
    }

    // Update mappings and arrays
    if (game.status == GameStatus.COMPLETED) {
        totalGamesPlayed++;
        gamesPlayed[game.creator]++;
        gamesPlayed[game.joiner]++;
        removeActiveGame(gameId);
        completedGameIds.push(gameId);

        // Transfer the battle fee to the treasury
        payable(treasury).transfer(battleFee);

        // Emit the GameCompleted event
        emit GameCompleted(gameId, game.winner, reward, moveToString(creatorMove), moveToString(joinerMove));
    }
}
```

### 6. Retrying a Game

The `retryGame` function allows players to retry a game after a draw:

```solidity
function retryGame(uint256 gameId, string memory move) external gameExists(gameId) notBlacklisted nonReentrant {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];
    // Ensure the game is in a retryable state
    require(game.status == GameStatus.DRAW || game.status == GameStatus.REDRAW, "Game is not in retry state");
    // Ensure the caller is a participant of the game
    require(msg.sender == game.creator || msg.sender == game.joiner, "Not a participant of this game");
    // Ensure the move is valid
    require(isValidMove(move), "Invalid move");

    // Update the move and status
    if (msg.sender == game.creator) {
        game.creatorMove = move;
        game.lastMoveTime = block.timestamp;
        if (bytes(game.joinerMove).length == 0) {
            game.status = GameStatus.REDRAW;
        }
    } else if (msg.sender == game.joiner) {
        game.joinerMove = move;
        game.lastMoveTime = block.timestamp;
        if (bytes(game.creatorMove).length == 0) {
            game.status = GameStatus.REDRAW;
        }
    }

    // Finalize the game if both moves are set
    if (bytes(game.creatorMove).length > 0 && bytes(game.joinerMove).length > 0) {
        finalizeGame(gameId);
    }

    // Emit the GameRedraw event
    emit GameRedraw(gameId, msg.sender);
}
```

### 7. Claiming a Win Due to Abandonment

The `claimWinDueToAbandonment` function allows a player to claim a win if the opponent has not moved within 48 hours:

```solidity
function claimWinDueToAbandonment(uint256 gameId) external gameExists(gameId) notBlacklisted nonReentrant {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];
    // Ensure the game is in a claimable state
    require(game.status == GameStatus.CREATED || game.status == GameStatus.JOINED || game.status == GameStatus.DRAW || game.status == GameStatus.REDRAW, "Game is not in a claimable state");
    // Ensure the caller is a participant of the game
    require(msg.sender == game.creator || msg.sender == game.joiner, "Not a participant of this game");
    // Ensure 48 hours have passed since the last move
    require(block.timestamp > game.lastMoveTime + 48 hours, "48 hours have not passed since the last move");

    address winner;
    if (msg.sender == game.creator && bytes(game.joinerMove).length == 0) {
        winner = game.creator;
    } else if (msg.sender == game.joiner && bytes(game.creatorMove).length == 0) {
        winner = game.joiner;
    } else {
        revert("The opponent has already made a move");
    }

    // Calculate the battle fee and reward
    uint256 battleFee = (game.betAmount * battleFeePercent) / 100;
    uint256 reward = (game.betAmount * 2) - battleFee;
    totalFeesCollected += battleFee;
    totalValueCollected += game.betAmount * 2;
    game.winner = winner;
    unclaimedRewards[winner] += reward;
    valueWon[winner] += reward;
    gamesWon[winner]++;
    game.status = GameStatus.ABANDONED;

    // Update mappings and arrays
    totalGamesPlayed++;
    gamesPlayed[game.creator]++;
    gamesPlayed[game.joiner]++;
    removeActiveGame(gameId);
    completedGameIds.push(gameId);

    // Transfer the battle fee to the treasury
    payable(treasury).transfer(battleFee);

    // Emit the GameAbandoned event
    emit GameAbandoned(gameId, winner);
}
```

### 8. Claiming Rewards

The `claimReward` function allows players to claim their unclaimed rewards:

```solidity
function claimReward() external notBlacklisted nonReentrant {
    uint256 reward = unclaimedRewards[msg.sender];
    // Ensure the user has unclaimed rewards
    require(reward > 0, "No unclaimed rewards");

    // Reset the unclaimed rewards to prevent double claiming
    unclaimedRewards[msg.sender] = 0;
    // Transfer the reward to the user
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(reward);

    // Emit the RewardClaimed event
    emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, reward);
}
```

### 9. Canceling a Game

The `cancelGame` function allows the owner to cancel a game in the CREATED or JOINED state:

```solidity
function cancelGame(uint256 gameId) external onlyOwner gameExists(gameId) nonReentrant {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];
    // Ensure the game is in a cancelable state
    require(game.status == GameStatus.CREATED || game.status == GameStatus.JOINED, "Game is not in cancelable state");

    // Calculate the cancel fee and refund amount
    uint256 cancelFee = (game.betAmount * cancelFeePercent) / 100;
    uint256 refundAmount = game.betAmount - cancelFee;

    // Update the total fees collected
    totalFeesCollected += cancelFee;
    // Remove the game from the active games list and delete it
    removeActiveGame(gameId);
    delete games[gameId];

    // Transfer the cancel fee to the treasury and the refund amount to the creator
    payable(treasury).transfer(cancelFee);
