## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the **TabbyWomBatRaceBetting** platformâ€”a decentralized betting solution built on the Ethereum blockchain. Leveraging smart contract technology and Chainlink price feeds, our platform offers users a secure, transparent, and engaging way to participate in race betting and trifecta jackpots.

---

## 2. Project Overview

**TabbyWomBatRaceBetting** is designed to facilitate betting on various races, allowing users to place wagers on contestants and potentially win substantial rewards. The platform incorporates a unique trifecta jackpot system, enabling users to predict the top three contestants and earn from collective winnings. Our mission is to provide a fair, decentralized, and user-friendly betting environment that maximizes transparency and minimizes fraud.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Race Management

- **Race Creation:** Authorized admins or operators can create new races, specifying details such as race time, number of contestants, race name, sponsor information, and descriptions.
- **Dynamic Contestants:** Each race can have a customizable number of contestants, allowing flexibility to accommodate various racing events.
- **Race Finalization:** After a race concludes, admins or operators can finalize the race by declaring the top three winners, triggering the distribution of the betting pool.

### 3.2 Betting Mechanism

- **USD-Based Betting:** Users place bets using native tokens (e.g., ETH), with the equivalent USD amount determined via Chainlink price feeds.
- **Multiple Bets:** Users can place multiple bets on different contestants within the same race.
- **Exact Amount Requirement:** To ensure fairness, users must send the exact native token equivalent of the USD ticket price when placing a bet.

### 3.3 Trifecta Jackpot System

- **Trifecta Bets:** Users can place trifecta bets by selecting three unique contestants, predicting the top three finishers in any order.
- **Jackpot Accumulation:** 80% of trifecta entry fees contribute to the growing jackpot, while 20% is allocated to the treasury.
- **Winnings Distribution:** Upon race finalization, users with matching trifecta bets can claim their share of the jackpot.

### 3.4 Sponsor Boosts

- **Additional Funding:** Sponsors can boost a race's pool by contributing extra funds while the race is open, increasing the potential winnings for participants.
- **Transparency:** All sponsor contributions are transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability.

### 3.5 Claim System

- **Individual Claims:** Users can claim their winnings from specific races they participated in.
- **Aggregate Claims:** Users have the option to claim all their accumulated winnings across races and trifecta bets in a single transaction.
- **Security:** Claims are processed securely using smart contract functions protected against reentrancy attacks.

### 3.6 Administrative Controls

- **Role Management:** Admins can transfer ownership, update operator and treasury addresses, set ticket and trifecta fees, and manage price feeds.
- **Fund Recovery:** Admins have the authority to recover native tokens from the contract to the treasury, ensuring fund management flexibility.
- **Access Restrictions:** Critical functions are restricted to authorized roles, preventing unauthorized access and potential abuse.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Smart Contract Structure

The **TabbyWomBatRaceBetting** smart contract is structured with modular components to handle various functionalities:

- **Enums & Structs:** Define race statuses, race details, user bets, and trifecta bets for organized data management.
- **State Variables:** Manage administrative roles, financial metrics, race data, user statistics, and prize distributions.
- **Modifiers:** Enforce access control and validate race IDs to maintain contract integrity.
- **Functions:** Implement race creation, betting, finalization, trifecta management, claiming winnings, and administrative tasks.
- **Events:** Emit events for critical actions, facilitating off-chain tracking and transparency.

### 4.2 Security Measures

- **Reentrancy Protection:** Inherited from a custom `ReentrancyGuard`, ensuring that sensitive functions cannot be exploited through reentrant calls.
- **Access Control:** Utilizes `onlyAdmin` and `onlyOperatorOrAdmin` modifiers to restrict function access to authorized roles.
- **Safe Ether Transfers:** Implements the `_safeTransfer` function using low-level `call` with proper error handling to ensure secure fund transfers.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that all inputs, such as race times, contestant numbers, and fee amounts, are valid and within expected ranges.

### 4.3 Price Feed Integration

- **Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface:** Integrates with Chainlink's price feeds to obtain the latest ETH/USD prices, enabling accurate conversion between USD-based fees and native tokens.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Requires that price feeds are set and returns valid data to prevent the use of stale or incorrect price information.

## 5. Economic Model

### 5.1 Fund Allocation

- **Betting Pool:** All user bets contribute to a race's total pool, which is distributed among winners upon race finalization.
- **Treasury Allocation:** A fixed percentage (20%) of each race's pool is allocated to the treasury, ensuring sustainable fund management and platform operations.
- **Trifecta Entry Fees:** 20% of trifecta entry fees are sent to the treasury, while the remaining 80% build the trifecta jackpot.

### 5.2 Jackpot Distribution

- **Race Winners:**
    - **First Place:** Receives 40% of the total pool.
    - **Second Place:** Receives 25% of the total pool.
    - **Third Place:** Receives 15% of the total pool.
    - **Treasury:** Retains 20% of the total pool.

- **Trifecta Winners:**
    - **Jackpot Share:** Upon correctly predicting the top three contestants, users can claim a share of the accumulated trifecta jackpot.
