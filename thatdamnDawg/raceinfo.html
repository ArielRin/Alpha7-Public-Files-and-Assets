        <hr>

        <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The traditional betting industry has long been centralized, often plagued by issues such as lack of transparency, security vulnerabilities, and limited user autonomy. With the advent of blockchain technology, decentralized betting platforms present a promising alternative, offering enhanced security, transparency, and user control.</p>
        <p><strong>TabbyWomBatRaceBetting</strong> aims to capitalize on these advantages by providing a decentralized platform for betting on races, enriched with a unique trifecta jackpot system that incentivizes participation and rewards users generously. By integrating Chainlink price feeds, the platform ensures accurate and reliable USD to ETH conversions, further enhancing user trust and platform integrity.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>3. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Despite the growth of decentralized applications (dApps), the betting sector faces several challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Centralized platforms often obscure bet distributions and jackpot calculations, leading to distrust among users.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> Central points of failure make platforms susceptible to hacks and fraud.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited User Autonomy:</strong> Users have minimal control over their funds and betting processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Rigid Betting Structures:</strong> Traditional betting systems offer limited flexibility in bet types and reward mechanisms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These issues hinder the widespread adoption of decentralized betting platforms and undermine user confidence.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>4. Solution</h2>
        <p><strong>TabbyWomBatRaceBetting</strong> addresses these challenges by offering a decentralized betting platform that ensures:</p>

            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All betting activities and jackpot distributions are recorded on the blockchain, allowing users to verify transactions independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Utilizing smart contract best practices, including reentrancy guards and strict access controls, to protect user funds and platform integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> Users retain full ownership of their funds and have the autonomy to place bets, manage trifecta entries, and claim winnings without intermediaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovative Betting Mechanisms:</strong> Introduction of a trifecta jackpot system with rollover capabilities enhances user engagement and reward potential.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Key Features</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Race Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Race Creation:</strong> Authorized admins or operators can create new races, specifying details such as race time, number of contestants, race name, sponsor information, and descriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Contestants:</strong> Each race accommodates a customizable number of contestants, allowing flexibility for different racing events.</li>
            <li><strong>Race Finalization:</strong> After a race concludes, admins or operators can finalize the race by declaring the top three winners, triggering the distribution of the betting pool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Betting Mechanism</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>USD-Based Betting:</strong> Users place bets using ETH, with the equivalent USD amount determined via Chainlink price feeds to ensure fairness and consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Bets:</strong> Users can place multiple bets on different contestants within the same race, increasing their chances of winning.</li>
            <li><strong>Exact Amount Requirement:</strong> To ensure fairness, users must send the exact ETH equivalent of the USD ticket price when placing a bet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Trifecta Jackpot System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trifecta Bets:</strong> Users can place trifecta bets by selecting three unique contestants, predicting the top three finishers in any order.</li>
            <li><strong>Jackpot Accumulation:</strong> 80% of trifecta entry fees contribute to the growing jackpot, while 20% is allocated to the treasury for platform sustainability.</li>
            <li><strong>Jackpot Rollover:</strong> If no trifecta bets are won in a round, the unclaimed jackpot rolls over to the next round, increasing the potential winnings and incentivizing continued participation.</li>
            <li><strong>Winnings Distribution:</strong> Upon race finalization, users with matching trifecta bets can claim their share of the accumulated jackpot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.4 Sponsor Boosts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Additional Funding:</strong> Sponsors can boost a race's pool by contributing extra funds while the race is open, enhancing the potential winnings for participants.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All sponsor contributions are transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability and fostering trust among users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.5 Claim System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Individual Claims:</strong> Users can claim their winnings from specific races they participated in.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregate Claims:</strong> Users can claim all their accumulated winnings across races and trifecta bets in a single transaction, streamlining the user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Claims are processed securely using smart contract functions protected against reentrancy attacks, ensuring the safety of user funds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.6 Administrative Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Role Management:</strong> Admins can transfer ownership, update operator and treasury addresses, set ticket and trifecta fees, and manage price feeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Fund Recovery:</strong> Admins have the authority to recover native tokens from the contract to the treasury, ensuring fund management flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Restrictions:</strong> Critical functions are restricted to authorized roles, preventing unauthorized access and potential abuse.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Events:</strong> Emit events for critical actions, facilitating off-chain tracking and transparency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 Security Measures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reentrancy Protection:</strong> Inherited from the <code>ReentrancyGuard</code> contract, ensuring that sensitive functions cannot be exploited through reentrant calls.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Utilizes <code>onlyAdmin</code> and <code>onlyOperatorOrAdmin</code> modifiers to restrict function access to authorized roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Safe Ether Transfers:</strong> Implements the <code>_safeTransfer</code> function using low-level <code>call</code> with proper error handling to ensure secure ETH transfers.</li>
            <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Ensures that all inputs, such as race times, contestant numbers, and fee amounts, are valid and within expected ranges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 Price Feed Integration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface:</strong> Integrates with Chainlink's price feeds to obtain the latest ETH/USD prices, enabling accurate conversion between USD-based fees and ETH.</li>
            <li><strong>Fallback Mechanisms:</strong> Requires that price feeds are set and returns valid data to prevent the use of stale or incorrect price information.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Trifecta Entry Fees:</strong> 20% of trifecta entry fees are sent to the treasury, while the remaining 80% build the trifecta jackpot.</li>
